The second big flaw is the screen to play a new game swishes through at lightening speed in a catch me if you can chase every four six games.  Finally  the ads seem to get more and more distracting as time goes by. Increased motion flying around the field of vision making difficult to use the app for MY intended purpose  to play the game. It is particularly difficult when working at the lower edge of the puzzle, as the field of play can no longer be moved to a more comfortable visual distance from the more nauseating ads.  I understand the ads are how the developer gets paid, but at the point when the ads are so overwhelming that the player shuts the game off instead of continuing to play, everybody loses player, developer, and sponsor.",0,0,1,1,-1

384,Minesweeper Reloaded,1.2,brokenroads37502,2011-12-21,3,Really annoyed by latest update,Game plays exactly like the original. Ever since this last update though I have been annoyed by the new process of starting a new game. In the old version it would automatically bring up the menu for restarting after you lost or won now you have to hit the pause button before the menu pops up. This can be very annoying especially when you hit a streak where the first thing that you tap on is a bomb thus losing that round. Oh and that streak continues for about 10 rounds. Especially when playing on the Hard setting. Please change it back to the way it was. It wasnt broken so why did you guys try to fix it? You broke it in the process.,0,0,1,1,0

Android or Mac. It has failed to play some tracks but there is sure to be another version among my 40,000 tracks. Editing is a breeze and changes can be saved Great as a Karaoke machine and great for midi backing tracks. But while playing, editing and flicking between screens it vanished? Still playing the track with a BLACK screen and no response. This happened more than once on different tracks? This is on a Galaxy s4 LTE with Snapdragon 800 and Android 4.4 Kit Kat so they dont come much more powerful than that yet. It gets a bit hot with intensive play but most of us have a backup or resort to an unplugged set. It is a 5 star app for any musician using midi and it eliminates the need for editing software and masses of time to massage files.

I own the following products:Xperia Tablet Z3 CompactSony Smartwatch3 Google Nexus5 The watch is on my all the time, the phone most of the time. Much of my music listening is via my phone.Obviously my phone not being an Xperia, means it doesnt log music listening, even if it was an Xperia, I dont want to use Walkman, I prefer to use Google Music all access, whic Lifelog doesnt monitor (at least not on my Xperia tablet).I also find that despite wearing my Smartwatch3, it doesnt track cycling. Apparently again, I need an Xperia phone to do that, which doesnt seem correct, as Google Fit tracks my activity just fine both on my watch and my Nexus5.I hope to see less restrictions in future versions of Lifelog, and embrace the Google apps more.

1564,lifelog_beta,,Fanny M,,0,,"Also, there is another issue that happens regardless of the device used: the automatic night mode comes in even if you are walking in the street, therefore if you forget to manually switch it back to day mode (with the danger to forget to switch back to night when you go to bed) it appears as sleep time during which you are awake and does not count your burnt calories during all that time. I think it should detect when you are awake and moving and better adjust automatically the set night/day mode accordingly. But that maybe depends more on the smartband device than on the application.That has another danger: that you manually turn the day mode on at night , and then forget to switch it back to night when you go to bed: then it does not register you as asleep even though there is no motion for hours. Maybe it should automatically return to night mode when you are not moving and it is within that time frame that you set as night automatically. In fact, the instructions say it automatically adjusts night/day according to your motions besides the automatically set hours, but it doesnt do that, or at least it doesnt do it during the night time. It seems to do that only when you wake up in the morning it goes to day time mode even if its still within the hours set as night in the automatic night setting.Other than that, Im enjoying the smartband features.",0,0,0,1,-1

1711,movieCreator_beta,,SiD Rhyte,,0,,"Hello. Happy to attend another beta, lets listen to the users as well as the professionals and keep it constructive. My main concerns at this point is the functionality of the app if you put it up against the move maker from the older generations. From the start I simply missed the feature to not automatically generate those movies at all since not all my photos are good memories, but still very important to keep for later reference. I love the features added to the beta, but it seems like I cant choose how mutch of a clip I want or how long each photo is on for. I absolutely love that you now can remove and change what goes on the move, and that you can select music is priceless. I have used quite a few video editors for computers, but there is no reason I cant use this app for my rather simple musicvideoes in the future if a few things gets a bit refined. Like for music selection you can set start point, but only to the closest second. I understand that eventually this feature will be available for videos, but if you can set points with greater accuracy lipsync would be within range. I understand that my needs are a bit outside normal, but one thing that I think everyone would enjoy would be to decide whether or not the audio from the videos are playing and maybe volume. I am yet to realy put it to the test, but I have used the app from the beginning, but never really enjoyed any of the movies until the beta features where added. Got to admit my life is rather tragic, but highlights from my life will be totally awesome when I can remove some of the not so bright moments since my phone is yet to understand witch captured moments I find beautiful and truly can be remembered as a highlight from my life",0,0,1,1,0

We believe this make the experience a bit better than the current static image. The behavior of the app when data traffic is unavailable. The offline search has been there all the time but many users seem to have missed that offline (pending) search is possible. We have addressed this by improving the information when no network is available. The TrackID charts is extended a bit more than the current 10 top items. The interesting variations in the charts actually happens a bit further down in the lists. Have a look and tell us what you think about longer charts.Of course we always appreciate feedback on things that do not work as well.Stay tuned, the new version is coming soon!",0,0,0,0,0

I like to listening to radio (in my phone). when theres a new song, I always use trackid recognize it. I keep use old version because the new version cant do this. please make new version can recognize song from internal speaker. I think users will love this fiture trackid once had a text search fiture. but why was that fiture deleted? its a very nice fiture. sometimes I know a song title but I forgot the artist name or I want to know the album title. with this fiture, i dont need to use tap to recognze. I just need to search it with text. its easier (and save more internet quota). please return this fiture. I dont like the design of the homepage. I suggest to return the history menu.or if you cant (idk why) i suggest to change the design. I think its more lovely if the album art smaller. so the album art arranged into two colomn. and the song title and the artist written below it. and also i dont like the Theres Search on youtube button below the songs detail. I suggest to add Search lyrics on google and Search song on google play music or Search song on google to download it :d. And add Search artist info on wikipedia below the artist info. Instead of our history, I think its better to show our favorites artist update, their post on social media, their newest song or video, etc. that will be great In artist info, please add their post on twitter, facebook or even instagram. add their video on youtube.

The randomized artwork for songs that are missing album art. We believe this makes the experience a bit better than the current static image.2. The behavior of the app when data traffic is unavailable. The offline search has been there all along but many users seem to have missed that offline (pending) search is possible. We have addressed this by improving the information when no network is available.3. The TrackID-charts is extended a bit more than the current 10 top items. The interesting variations in the charts actually happens a bit further down in the lists. Have a look and tell us what you think about longer charts.We really want to know what you think about these changes and overall experience.If you dont get the notification, go to Google Play to manually update:",0,0,0,0,0
3011,trackID_beta,,Samuele Farfarini,,0,,"I just joined this beta program and I stressed a bit the application: what I like most is the possibility to play most of the recognised songs on Spotify. I have the premium there and Im not interested in using other platforms. However roughly forty percent of songs played (from spotify) didnt had the link to spotify, which is kinda weird because I was playing them from... Spotify, on PC.Also, i found the recognition strong in particular on classical music if compared with other platforms (I mean, those software are NEVER good enough on classical, but I made a selective comparative with Google music search, shazam and soundcloud, and TrackID is the best one right now), but weak in everything else. Its weakness is particularly evident in movies soundtracks when there was no way to have recognised songs about ultra famous movies and authors, like Morricone, Zimmer and Tiersen. Even with indie music (always available on spotify, only tracks with rating >forty thaousand) it has serious issues. No problem with famous rock and pop songs. Expecially with pop songs its lightning fast, but the song has to be very mainstream. I suggest the killer feature could be a way to train it, like the possibility to give it a link with the source it wasnt able to recognise. (maybe from filtered sources, like Google play music or spotify, to avoid the risk to learn from a low quality content).(I personally developed a similar system for patent data mining and contextual search, and after 1 year of development without significant improvements, giving it the patent and make it learn from the source it wasnt able to discover was the best solution to improve the performance). Anyway, I personally appreciate the ease to use and the interface. Im sure it has the potential to become one of the best software out there, but it still need a lot of work.I hope my small feedback could be helpful.",1,0,0,1,0

I used to be able to play mp4 file with SRT subtitle file with no problem but now subtitle keeps disappear or doesnt show, even worse the film went dark screen and other video with no subtitle cannot be played (seems like SRT file in the same folder of the film with the same name effects the rest of the movies files and app).

I think this is the Video app not Album so everything should be animated from video thumbnails to header bar to video name (those that are too long)3- Side menu could have semi-transparant background like Whats new but its not mandatory, I just want a more consistent UI across apps. Music start to use main purple color with green accent color in the UI which I think is nice so why dont Video and Album do the same? (like red-cyan and yellow-blue for example)The rest is good.
